1. WINDOW :

=> Window is the main JavaScript object root, the global object in a browser, also can be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as window.
   
   Well, the window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name,
   if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
   
   
2. DOCUMENT :

=> The Document object(DOM) is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and 
   has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, 
   if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
   
   window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible document object model/DOM.
   
   
   
3. SCREEN :

=> The Window object also has a screen object with properties describing the physical display:
   screen properties width and height are the full screen
   screen properties availWidth and availHeight omit the toolbar
   
   window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
